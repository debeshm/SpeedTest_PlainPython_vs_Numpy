# SpeedTest_PlainPython_vs_Numpy

## Matrix Multiplication Performance Comparison

This repository contains a simple comparison of matrix multiplication performance between plain Python code and NumPy. The comparison is performed on 1000x1000 matrices.

### Introduction

Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in many scientific and engineering applications. This project highlights the significant performance differences between a plain Python implementation and an optimized NumPy implementation.

### Performance Results

- **Plain Python matrix multiplication**: 127.83 seconds
- **NumPy matrix multiplication**: 0.02 seconds

The results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of NumPy for matrix operations due to its use of optimized libraries.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library
- Matplotlib library (for plotting the performance comparison)

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
